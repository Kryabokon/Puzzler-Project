 **Code Name….Tubeship**
 
As I part of a course for Udacity I have developed "Tubeship Experiment" where the player was  placed in space like environment in front of a ship with strange and unfamiliar design. Tube shaped ship contain simple Simon says the type of experience.
And whomever behind this puzzle really is not impressed that easily

**Comments**

The Puzzler Project was definitely huge learning experience with Unity program, with design process from scratch and documenting every step along the way. Thought the course I was eager to learn new information so I can use it in creative way, more I gathered more possibilities were uncovered. But real learning came from, mistakes and misfortunes. when something different have happened, something just broke or stopped working.  But every time when something started working erratic I would ether gather a new instrument for my tool-belt or polish skills or routine troubleshooting techniques that have I already knew.

**Final Demo of "Tubeship Project"**

>This video demonstrates the gameplay of the project. It has some custom animation and somewhat different design choices. The Player present with a simplistic Start menu when the player interact with it BU gaze and click the doors will open in dramatic way. Afterwards player will gently float to the mysterious panel which will present a simple "repeat after me" puzzle. If the puzzle is failed the player will hear rejecting sound. Upon successful completion of the puzzle. The panel will slide downwards and the door would open. All animation have been done in some what futuristic or unknown technology type of style. After all animations have finished the Restart UI will appear and the player will float to it.(and see that the puzzle wasn't a big deal :confused: .). From Here player can chose to restart or abandon the game. If player choose to restart all animations and properties would be set do default  or idle.
-What you not supposed to know that Aliens wants you to play this game forever-.

**Sketches and Earlier Design**

Earlier sketch promised sandwich for player. Later the blueprint was simplified due to complications with design.
>I end up going with a space themed Puzzler as I felt like the movement in VR have not have been perfect and still perceives like floating. And in my opinion the best place to float it is in **Space**!


>After a thoughtful consideration there was decision to animation gates in a somewhat complex way. Even so I have used animation in previous course I was still unfamiliar with the process, so it took me a while to fully grasp the Unity tool capability.This Gate opening animation still appear in my nightmares sometimes...


>Slow polish of a simple design lead to a more complex structure.Even when I have finished "cool" gate animation the space have seemed a bit empty and simple. I have used Dungeon prefabs quite a bit. For example the ships hull was made out of one element in dungeon ceiling. And the floor illumination nothing else than flattened barrels.


>User testing have shown that spaceship still haven't been identified and place haven't been recognizable enough.I decided to take a shot with Unity Store asset and get me some props. 


>User testing has proved as well that lightning was too much and it somewhat stressed frame rate so it was toned down to reasonable standards.


>After initial framework was done there was a need for a more complicated script, So I have made some improvements to a provided code. Animations, sounds and miscellaneous finally starting to come along nicely.

**Persona**

For Persona I choose photo of me when I was definitely **not** going through.. hippy phase…

Initially App was targeted for teenagers and young adult seeking new experiences. In this case it is simple re-playable experience which is polished and due to a VR technology quite innovative in its nature.

**User testing** 
My wife have helped me a lot with User testing. When I have first started I used more simplistic design just to test a scale and check how simulations sickness may have reveal it self. I Asked several questions from numerous builds. And here some  most useful feedback that I got. 
 
>Very fist Build . 
> 
>**How big do you think you are?** 
>_I am smaller then I am in real life_ 
>**Why do you think that?** 
>_Everything is big and grotesque_ 
>**How is interface makes you feel?** 
>_I like it is simple and intuitive_  
>**What Kind of mood do you feel in this place** 
>_It is mysterious and spooky_ 

(it wasn't what I was going for in the first build but I mysterious lightning suited my project better then magical)
 
After I resolved scaling and building project further more interesting finds appear 
 
>**From one of the latest and most productive User tests.** 
>
>**Where do you think you are at the moment** 
>_I am in space, it is really pretty_ 
>"After couple of moments admiring the new skybox she presses start and gate animation is triggered" 
>**What do you think of animation?** 
>_It is very....Futuristic like...I definitely like it_ 
>**Do you feel it was too much in you face?** 
>_Yes a little bit I was too close to it_  
> 
**_At the moment I placed a bit to close  to gates and didn't realize it until user testing_** 
> 
>**How is this place makes you feel?** 
>_It is really bright for space isn't it? Also everything is a bit wobbly I feel a Little bit dizzy_ 
> 
**_The Frame rate went a bit low because I used to much particles and lightning_** 
 
**_She struggles a lot with a puzzle because in this build puzzle length was 6 buttons in a row_** 

>_I can't do this puzzle it is to difficult and I can't see when it blinks twice or not. And colors are too similar_ 
> 
>**_At the moment the buttons where quite similar and there was almost next to none change in appearance when light up_** 
 
I have changed a lot in the project after that user test starting from the lightning it was too much so I toned it down a bit. And button colors where changed to opposite color for more contrast. The speed and length of the puzzle it self was simplified as well. Main camera and movements points where moved further away as well. After this I had more user tests but she provided only positive feedback.

**Conclusion**
Next steps are definitely consisted of more detailed and ambient environment development with use of more advanced tool which I hope to learn thought that course and additional courses that I have taken. with focus on animation and UI elements. And more in deep investigations of User testing processes. Unfortunately I don't have any pictures of user testing. But my _user_ helped me a lot with this project she did all of my testing and provided me with the most detailed insights that helped me view this project from a lot of different perspective. Such us lightning intensity, Puzzle speed and movement pattern and overall atmosphere of the experience.Actually there is one of her pictures in a bonus area.
