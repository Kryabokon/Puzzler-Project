**Code Name….Tubeship**
 
As a part of Udacity course I have developed "Tubeship Experiment" where a player is placed in space environment in front of a spaceship with strange and unfamiliar design. Tube shaped ship contain simple "Simon Says" type of experience.

**Comments**

The Puzzler Project with design process from scratch and documenting every step along the way was definitely a huge learning experience with Unity program. Through the course I was eager to learn new information so I can use it in creative way. More konowledge I gathered gave more possibilities to uncover. But real learning came from mistakes and misfortunes: when something different happened,something just broke down or stopped working.  But every time when something started working erratic I would either gather a new instrument for my tool-belt or polish skills or routine troubleshooting techniques that have I already knew.

**Final Demo of "Tubeship Project"**

>This video demonstrates the gameplay of the project. It has some custom animation and somewhat different design choices. The player is presented with a simplistic start menu where the player interacts with it by gaze input and click. After that the door opens in dramatic way and the player gently floats to a mysterious panel which presents a simple "repeat after me" puzzle. If the puzzle is failed, the player will hear rejecting sound. Upon successful completion of the puzzle, the panel will slide downwards and the door will open. All animation have been done in futuristic or alien type of style. After all animations are finished, the Restart UI appears and the player floats to it (and sees that the puzzle wasn't a big deal :confused: .). From here the player can choose to restart or abandon the game. If the player choose to restart, all animations and properties would be set do default  or idle.

-What you not supposed to know that Aliens wants you to play this game forever-.

**Sketches and Earlier Design**

Earlier sketch promised sandwich for the player. Later the blueprint was simplified due to complications with design.
>I ended up going with a space themed Puzzler as I felt like movement in VR have not been perfect and still being perceived like floating. And, in my opinion, the best place to float is in **Space**!


>After a thoughtful consideration I decided to animate gates in a complex way. Even though I have used animation in previous course I was still not quite confident with the process so it took me a while to fully grasp the Unity tool capability. This gate opening animation still appears in my nightmares sometimes...


>Slow polish of simple design led to a more complex structure. Even when I have finished "cool" gate animation, the space seemed a bit empty and simple. I have used Dungeon prefabs quite a bit. For example the ships hull was made out of one element in dungeon ceiling. And the floor illumination is nothing else than flattened barrels.


>User testing showed that the spaceship still hasn't been identified and the place hasn't been recognizable enough. I decided to take a shot with Unity Store asset and get some props. 


>User testing has proved as well that lightning was too much and it stressed frame rate so it was toned down to reasonable standards.


>After initial framework was done there was a need for more complicated script. I have made some improvements to a provided code. Animations, sounds and miscellaneous have finally started to come along nicely.

**Persona**

For the persona I chose a photo of me when I was definitely **not** going through.. hippy phase…

Initially app was targeted for teenagers and young adults seeking new experiences. In this case it is simple re-playable experience which is polished and due to VR technology quite innovative in its nature.

**User testing** 
My wife have helped me a lot with user testing. When I have first started I used more simplistic design just to test a scale and check how simulations sickness may have reveal itself. I asked several questions from numerous builds. And here are some most useful feedback that I got. 
 
>Very fist build. 
> 
>**How big do you think you are?** 
>_I am smaller then I am in real life._ 
>**Why do you think that?** 
>_Everything is big and grotesque._ 
>**How does interface make you feel?** 
>_I like that it is simple and intuitive._  
>**What kind of mood do you feel in this place** 
>_It is mysterious and spooky._ 

(it wasn't what I was going for in the first build but mysterious lightning suited my project better then magical)
 
After I resolved scaling and building project further more interesting finds would appear 
 
>**From one of the latest and most productive user tests.** 
>
>**Where do you think you are at the moment?** 
>_I am in space, it is really pretty._ 
>"After couple of moments admiring the new skybox she presses start and gate animation is triggered" 
>**What do you think of animation?** 
>_It is very....futuristic like...I definitely like it._ 
>**Do you feel it was too much in front of your face?** 
>_Yes a little bit I was too close to it._  
> 
**_At the moment I placed animation a bit too close to gates and didn't realize it until user testing_** 
> 
>**How is this place makes you feel?** 
>_It is really bright for space, isn't it? Also everything is a bit wobbly and I feel a Little bit dizzy._ 
> 
**_The frame rate went a bit low because I used to much particles and lightning._** 
 
**_She struggles a lot with a puzzle because puzzle length in this build was 6 buttons in a row._** 

>_I can't do this puzzle as it is too difficult and I can't see if it blinks twice or not. And colors are too similar._ 
> 
>**_At the moment the buttons where quite similar and there was almost next to none change in appearance when they lighted up._** 
 
I have changed a lot in the project after that user test. The lightning was too bright so I toned it down a bit. And button colors were changed to opposite color for more contrast. The speed and length of the puzzle itself was simplified as well. Main camera and movements points were moved further away as well. After all these changes I had more user tests where she provided only positive feedback.

**Conclusion**
<i>Next steps consisted of more detailed and ambient environment development with the use of advanced tool which I hope to learn through this course and additional courses that I have taken. with focus on animation and UI elements. And more in deep investigations of user testing processes.</i> Unfortunately I don't have any pictures of user testing. But my _user_ helped me a lot with this project as she did all of my testing and provided me with the most detailed insights that helped me view this project from different perspectives such as lightning intensity, puzzle speed and movement pattern and overall atmosphere of the experience.
